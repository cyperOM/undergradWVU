============
This code has been uploaded online for the sole purpose of showing potential future employers my strength and weaknesses
when it comes to coding in the various languages I learned while being an undergrad at WVU.
The material that represents my potential the most are school projects I've done in the past. 

Do NOT:
- copy my code and turn it in as your own
- use part of my code and turn it in as your own
- "modify" my code and turn it in as your own
