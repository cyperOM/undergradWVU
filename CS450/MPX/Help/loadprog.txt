The load Program command loads a file 
into memory for execution. The file needs
to be a .mpx file.

There are two ways to call this command:

1st way:

Takes in one parameter which is a string
loadProgram(Process name);

Example: loadProgram(proc1);

2nd way:

Takes in two parameters. First one is a
string and the second parameter is an integer
loadProgram(Process name, priority);

Example: loadProgram(proc1,1);
