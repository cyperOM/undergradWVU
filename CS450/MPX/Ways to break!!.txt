-------------------------
loadProc();

load processes then use show all to make sure all 5 processes is in the queue
do multiple times to make sure PCB's cant have the same name.
-------------------------
dispatch();

dispatch when nothing in the queues
dispatch with r3 processes loaded (loadProc)
dispatch with r4 processes loaded (loadProgram)
dispatch with both r3 and r4 processes
3x(load r3, dispatch, load r4 dispatch, load r3 and r4 dispatch)

-------------------------
loadProgram(string,int) or loadProgram(string)

load all programs (proc1-5) then dispatch
load 1 program then dispatch
load 2 programs then dispatch
load 3 programs then dispatch
load 4 programs then dispatch
load program with negative priority 
load program with bad priority (try alot of them)
load program with an already existing name
load program with no existing file name (no file in directory)

-------------------------
terminateProc(string);

load a process/program then terminate it. use ShowAll(); to make sure that it has been deleted.
terminate a process that isnt in a queue
